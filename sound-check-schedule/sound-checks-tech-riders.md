## Sound Check Time: 11:45am - 12:15pm

**Composer:** Bruno Ruviaro  
**Title:** *Notoligotoma hardyi*


**Performers:**  
  
* Dustin Donahue, percussion
  


**Tech Needs:**

This is a piece for one percussion player and live-electronics (stereo). If accepted, both composer and performer would be present at the symposium to perform it. We would bring our own set of percussive instruments, as well as contact mics and other equipment necessary to run the piece. We need to send a stereo signal out from our audio interface into the venue's stereo system. Depending on size of venue, slight amplification of percussion instruments might be advisable.

## Sound Check Time: 12:15pm - 1pm

**Composer:** Derek Worthington  
**Title:** *Lossy Codecs*


**Performers:**  
  
* James Annett, viola

* Kerrith Livengood, flute
  
* Maxwell Miller, guitar
  
* Mason Moy, tuba
  
* Hyunkyung Shin, contrabass
  


**Tech Needs:**

There are two setup options for this performance: 1) Two TVs with HDMI or USB input on a low table, angled so all musicians can see  (If HDMI cables and a splitter can be provided, I won’t need to bring my own) 2) A projector with HDMI or USB input. This will only work if there is a suitable surface on which to project that the ensemble can see clearly while performing; the audience does not need to see it.  For either of the above methods, the following will also be needed: A small or medium table/surface at standing level for the director (to hold laptop and 2 midi controllers) Chairs for musicians and one shared music stand for every two performers (for reference sheets) Power strip  I will provide my own laptop and midi controllers
