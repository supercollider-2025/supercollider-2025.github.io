## Program Notes

### *Improvisation*

by:  
[Sam Pluta](/bios/#sam-pluta)  
[Bonnie Lander](/bios/#bonnie-lander)  


Bonnie Lander and Sam Pluta have been performing in duo and other formations for the past 3 years. Their practice combines Lander’s virtuosic vocal technique with Pluta’s myriad synthesis and live-manipulation processes.

### *Live for Life*

by [Christophe Lengelé](/bios/#christophe-lengelé)

This project is an electronic improvisation using SuperCollider-based synthesis and recordings from various electronic machines, including modular synthesizers, analog and digital synthesizers, and drum machines. The primary sound source consists of over 2 gigabytes of samples, containing more than 5,500 sounds, organized into multiple folders for real-time manipulation. The improvisation focuses on creating evolving soundscapes by combining pre-recorded samples and live synthesis.

In addition to the Live For Life programme (https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life), I will simultaneously use a new programme that I am currently developing, which integrates Tidal Cycles, SuperCollider, and various extensions quark, including SuperDirtMixer. This system features a GUI and controllers that execute command lines in Tidal Cycles and control multiple patterns and their variables (tempo, duration, synthesis, effects, or functions in patterns. It functions as a form of live coding DJing, where code lines replace traditional samples or records. The interface is still in development, with a public release planned for January 2025.

### *Live Coding Performance*

by [Eli Fieldsteel](/bios/#eli-fieldsteel)

This submission proposes an improvised live coded performance, which is listed as a topic on the Call for Contributions. Ideally, this performance would occur at a late-night venue (e.g. a restaurant/bar or similar), which provides an atmosphere in which a relatively long and slow-evolving performance is more contextually appropriate. If this is not an option, a performance on the concert stage is also acceptable. Most rehearsals and performances in the past have lasted for about 30 minutes. If this is deemed too long for any reason, the duration can be shortened by leaning away from free improvisation and preparing more of the performance code in advance.

### *Microwebs*

by [Bruno Gola](/bios/#bruno-gola)

Microwebs is a hybrid between live improvisational performance and installation for dynamic multichannel setups using audience's mobile phones as a sound system. The performance explores the relationship between cybernetic music, intuitive playing with macro-controls and influence, while also expanding those ideas into the audience participation via sound and space activation. During the live performance the audience is invited to explore the intra-action between sounds while the performer improvises with influence parameters. The resulting experience is a combination of relations between sound processes internally feedbacking in webs of sounds, the audience exploring the space with their mobiles as sound sources, and the performer influencing back the sound processes.
