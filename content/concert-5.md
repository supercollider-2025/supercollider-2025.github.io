## Program Notes

### *Metacortical Modulations*

by [Kosmas Giannoutakis](/bios/#kosmas-giannoutakis)

*Metacortical Modulations* explores a mode of post-human musical expression through an intricate coupling of biological signals, algorithmic processes, and community-driven creativity. Utilizing a Brain Control Interface (BCI), the performer captures and live-maps brainwave and muscle tone data to modulate parameters of SCTweetsâ€”concise code snippets composed by various authors and shared within the SuperCollider community. This performative framework integrates somatic and machinic data streams with the collective creative output of a global network of computer musicians in a hyper-dynamic, unpredictable and non-hierarchical fashion. The resulting soundscape traverses a spectrum of sonic textures, from noise and drones to rhythmic irregularities and fragile frequencies, all emerging from the interplay between the performer's physiological state, digital glitches, non-linear feedback and the diverse algorithmic expressions of the SCTweet authors. By eschewing traditional notions of individual authorship and musical control, this performance manifests a form of distributed creativity that blurs the boundaries between human intention, bodily processes, computational algorithms, and communal creativity, while celebrating the social and collaborative ethos of the computer music community.

### ***Improvisation** by mod f*

by:  
[Maxwell Gong](/bios/#maxwell-gong)  
[Alexander Wu](/bios/#alexander-wu)  


mod f is an electronic improvising duo of Alexander Wu and Maxwell Gong. In their music, the material world is distorted, physicality decoupled from sound waves; metaphors feed back into one another and into themselves. mod f constructs fragile moments of tranquility within chaotic systems and carves out dissenting spaces from the static humming of electric current.
