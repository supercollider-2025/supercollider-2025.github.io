## Program Notes

### *Metacortical Modulations*

by [Kosmas Giannoutakis](/bios/#kosmas-giannoutakis)

*Metacortical Modulations* explores a mode of post-human musical expression through an intricate coupling of biological signals, algorithmic processes, and community-driven creativity. Utilizing a Brain Control Interface (BCI), the performer captures and live-maps brainwave and muscle tone data to modulate parameters of SCTweets—concise code snippets composed by various authors and shared within the SuperCollider community. This performative framework integrates somatic and machinic data streams with the collective creative output of a global network of computer musicians in a hyper-dynamic, unpredictable and non-hierarchical fashion. The resulting soundscape traverses a spectrum of sonic textures, from noise and drones to rhythmic irregularities and fragile frequencies, all emerging from the interplay between the performer's physiological state, digital glitches, non-linear feedback and the diverse algorithmic expressions of the SCTweet authors. By eschewing traditional notions of individual authorship and musical control, this performance manifests a form of distributed creativity that blurs the boundaries between human intention, bodily processes, computational algorithms, and communal creativity, while celebrating the social and collaborative ethos of the computer music community.

### *Harmonic Turbulences*

by [Gaël Moriceau](/bios/#gaël-moriceau)

This performance, for T-Stick and FM synthesis, offers an immersion into a synthetic soundscape inspired by the calm moments and storms of nature. The sound textures, in constant metamorphosis, evolve from delicate layers to gusty winds, providing a dynamic and immersive auditory experience.

### *Rock Music*

by [Kyle Shaw](/bios/#kyle-shaw)

*Rock Music* is an 8-channel fixed-media composition. Supercollider provided all of the DSP needs for this piece -- granular synthesis UGens, resonant filter UGens, FFT UGens, wavetable synthesis, on top of writing my own functions to compose the piece's gestures and writing my own reverb SynthDef.

### ***Improvisation** by mod f*

by:  
[Maxwell Gong](/bios/#maxwell-gong)  
[Alexander Wu](/bios/#alexander-wu)  


mod f is an electronic improvising duo of Alexander Wu and Maxwell Gong. In their music, the material world is distorted, physicality decoupled from sound waves; metaphors feed back into one another and into themselves. mod f constructs fragile moments of tranquility within chaotic systems and carves out dissenting spaces from the static humming of electric current.
