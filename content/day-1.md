## Keynote Address: James McCartney  
**Room 426/428**  
9am - 10am  

James McCartney studied computer science and electronic music at the University of Texas at Austin. He wrote music for various dance and drama productions in Austin, and later created the SuperCollider programming language for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. For a few years he worked on the Hubble Space Telescope project on software for observation planning and data analysis. He worked for 16 years at Apple in the CoreAudio group. Now he is retired and pursuing further interests in possibilities for audio synthesis environments.
