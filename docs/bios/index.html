<h2 id="christophe-lengelé">Christophe Lengelé</h2>
<p>I am spatial sound designer and performer for electronic and experimental music. I particularly focus on the development of live experimental audio tools and interfaces built from open source softwares like SuperCollider.  After studying law and economics and working as a marketing and market analyst in international companies for a few years, I trained and worked from 2008 to 2012 at the Municipal Conservatory Georges Bizet of the 20th district of Paris and obtained a Master of Arts in computer music at Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée in 2014 and a Doctorate in music (composition and sound design) at Université de Montréal in 2022. Then, I followed a postdoctoral research/creation in spatial improvisation at Université du Québec à Montréal until august 2024.  I seek to bring together the spheres of composition and improvisation and focus on performing variable spatio-temporal pieces with a global custom live tool. I have been regularly developing this tool since 2011, in order to “play the place and the music at the same time”. My spatial research, which questions ways of associating rhythmic and spatial parameters, is based on the concept of free and open works, both from the point of view of form and in the diffusion of open source code (<a href="https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life)">https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life)</a>.  My works have been presented and performed internationally, particularly at the International Computer Music Conference (2018, 2021, 2024), during the Journées d’Informatique Musicale in France (2017, 2019), at Akousma Festival 2021 (Montréal, Canada), as well as at Cube Fest 2022 (Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA), at Gala Hexagram 2023 (Montréal, Canada), and more recently at Ateliers Belleville (Montréal, Canada) in 2024. I am the recipient of several research-creation grants.</p>

Having obtained a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Digital Music from UdeM in 2022, Gaël primarily explores the acousmatic genre in his compositions, aiming to immerse listeners in abstract and unknown sonic spaces. He employs both field recording and computer synthesis (Max/MSP, SuperCollider), as well as various spatialization techniques, to craft unique sound objects and textures. Gaël’s research focuses on composing electroacoustic pieces specifically designed for digital musical instruments (DMI). He places particular emphasis on exploring the relationship between gesture and sound for the T-Stick and developing new playing techniques for this instrument. The principal objective is to expand the repertoire of DMIs, encourage their adoption among composers and performers, and ensure their enduring relevance and longevity within the music community.</p>

<p>I am an improvising electronic musician, digital luthier, educator, and labor organizer trained as an archivist who transparently resignifies archaic tools and materials to reveal how gendered technologies mediate gendered labors. I often focus on memory as a site of critical agency and accountability. I value machines as musical instruments for their patience and their capacity to remember. In my creative practice, I challenge how ‘authenticity’ is performed in the creation of electronic musical instruments; how ‘virtuosity’ is performed on electronic musical instruments; and how ‘genius’ is performed in institutional histories. I am employed as an Assistant Professor of Electronic Production and Design | Creative Coding at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., and Councilor with MS1140 American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts.</p>
