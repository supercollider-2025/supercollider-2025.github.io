<p>In her book My Mother Was a Computer: Digital Subjects and Literary Texts, literary theorist and critic Katherine Hayles posits that; as computers are increasingly understood, and modeled after “expressive mediums” like writing, they begin to acquire the familiar and potent capability of writing not merely to express thought but actively to constitute it.</p>
<p>The code of the future will become more like the writing of the past – or rather, in the future there will be an as-yet-concealed hybrid of code and writing.</p>
<p>It is on this path on which I write this self essay about how I wrote and how I write computer music code. In it, I wonder about how formal language permeates the concepts of score, musical instrument, composition and performance among others. These structures become not only an expression of an abstract process or thought, but also an expression of itself, or of its own &ldquo;vitalism&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I allow myself to explore the live coding technique as a way to interact with such complex entities.</p>

<p>This research explores live-coding techniques for developing accessible, interactive musical instruments within SuperCollider. It focuses on an enhanced real-time co-design process providing instantaneous adaptation to users&rsquo; evolving needs, particularly for music students with disabilities. The approach integrates dynamic code manipulation, AI assistance, and the adaptation of Airsticks, a gestural musical instrument.</p>

<p>At the symposium, I will present a series of works that make use of Supercollider (SC) to organize, sonify data and manage interactions through a variety of means. For example, Aeolian Traces (2016) was a multi sensory project exploring spatial sound and data visualization of narratives of human migration, including community focused work on the undocumented migrant population in Seattle. The system centrally run through SC uses geolocation datasets to drive wind currents through Arduino controlled cooling fans, networking with Processing for real time visualization, and spatial sound propagation through a low cost Ambisonic 16 channel setup. Similarly, in, Birdsong Diamond (2015-19) a user interface was built in SC to control the interactive component of the installation where visitors were invited to mimic birdsongs and given an eventual score for their attempts. More recently, the project untitled interspecies umwelten (2022-current) is an artistic research project exploring expanded and computer-mediated experiences of conversation with other species.  The project networks computer vision, LLM APIs to control interaction, text generation.  Responding to the question of the future of SC, these humble experiments propose to highlight the way SC can be instrumental as a central control system for multi-programmatic outputs.  I am more immediately a part of the user-group that has a limited but sustained experience with SC and moderate dexterity within its programming environment, so accessibility and longevity of these tools are one reason SC has remained a pivotal tool for my work. My aim at this conference would be to learn and adopt new approaches and in envisioning them within ongoing and new project, help shape its role in the future of creative systems and collaborative work.</p>
