Program Notes
The Absolute Relativity
by Alberto de Campo &amp; Bruno Gola
The Absolute Relativity performance is the result of a workshop with 5-7 symposium participants. In this performance we explore the different possibilities of mutual influence in a collective performance environment written in SuperCollider, the NTMI. This environment is designed for exploring complex sound processes by intuitive interaction, and has recently been expanded for finely gradable layers of shared influence between multiple players.  In advance of the symposium, we will send an open call to the participants inviting people to sign up for a workshop and prepare two to three sound processes to be integrated into NTMI.">

<p>The Absolute Relativity performance is the result of a workshop with 5-7 symposium participants. In this performance we explore the different possibilities of mutual influence in a collective performance environment written in SuperCollider, the NTMI. This environment is designed for exploring complex sound processes by intuitive interaction, and has recently been expanded for finely gradable layers of shared influence between multiple players.  In advance of the symposium, we will send an open call to the participants inviting people to sign up for a workshop and prepare two to three sound processes to be integrated into NTMI.</p>
<p>During the concert we collectively play with this environment and each other sound worlds. The performance can be between 30 and 60 minutes. Depending on the available time we can show different influence topologies and strategies in the environment.</p>
<h3 id="metacortical-modulations"><em>Metacortical Modulations</em></h3>
<p>by <a href="/bios/#kosmas-giannoutakis">Kosmas Giannoutakis</a></p>
<p><em>Metacortical Modulations</em> explores a mode of post-human musical expression through an intricate coupling of biological signals, algorithmic processes, and community-driven creativity. Utilizing a Brain Control Interface (BCI), the performer captures and live-maps brainwave and muscle tone data to modulate parameters of SCTweets—concise code snippets composed by various authors and shared within the SuperCollider community. This performative framework integrates somatic and machinic data streams with the collective creative output of a global network of computer musicians in a hyper-dynamic, unpredictable and non-hierarchical fashion. The resulting soundscape traverses a spectrum of sonic textures, from noise and drones to rhythmic irregularities and fragile frequencies, all emerging from the interplay between the performer&rsquo;s physiological state, digital glitches, non-linear feedback and the diverse algorithmic expressions of the SCTweet authors. By eschewing traditional notions of individual authorship and musical control, this performance manifests a form of distributed creativity that blurs the boundaries between human intention, bodily processes, computational algorithms, and communal creativity, while celebrating the social and collaborative ethos of the computer music community.</p>

<p>mod f is an electronic improvising duo of Alexander Wu and Maxwell Gong. In their music, the material world is distorted, physicality decoupled from sound waves; metaphors feed back into one another and into themselves. mod f constructs fragile moments of tranquility within chaotic systems and carves out dissenting spaces from the static humming of electric current.</p>
